This is the code for the game I made throughout my high school senior year in Java.
I've recently been attempting to clean it up in the hopes of making it easier to add new features.
As of writing this, the cleanup is still ongoing...

Also, fair warning: attempting to run this may soft-lock your computer, especially if you're on a Mac.
