This is the code for the game I made throughout my senior year in Java.
It was a fun project and I hope I can continue to work on it into college.
If you would like to use any of my code you can, however, some of the code is from David Brackeen's, "Developing Games in Java"
  so you might need his permission as well (however I believe his code is open source anyway)
